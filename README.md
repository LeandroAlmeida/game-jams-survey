# Game jams Survey

What We Do
We are researchers from Brazil. We want to find out how participants seek and get help during the Global Game Jam 2020, most importantly, how people with different demographic data collaborate. To do so, we conducted a survey with participants of the Global Game Jam (GGJ) 2020. Initially, we collected information from participants around the world through the email information made available on the eventsâ€™ website on which people willing to participate in the jam had to sign up before the event. We then distributed an online survey to these participants. We received in total 3197 answers that agreed to participate (as a volunteer) in our research.

This is a purely academic research project with no commercial interests. We will openly publish the results so everyone can benefit from them, but will anonymize everything before doing so. We will handle the responses confidentially.
