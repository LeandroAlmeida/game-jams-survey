I know how to guide a group to better ideas of games to make during a jam, and even adapting to what the participants want out of the jam. I know what gets a lot of popular votes, as well as giving a unique experience to players, as well as how to learn something new during a jam.
Another way I help a lot is by having a lot of technical skill in many different areas. On this jam for example, I gave out advice on programming, game design, 3D & 2D animation, UI & UX, and lastly, asset creation and image filters on photoshop. All of this was done while I walked through the groups and learned about their games, then asking if I could give them feedback on specific things.

On another hand, I often get help from the staff or support people to complete random stuff I needed done (such as cutting a 3m long and 5mm thick paper tube into smaller pieces) or obtain and spread information (such as ""where is the urn we put this ticket in to get prizes?!?!"" followed with ""at the front of the main auditorium, just after the voting time ends!"")
I also help around at the end of the jam to clean up and organize the site.

Sometimes, he didn't even know how to code specific feature( We are hobby programmer, this happens a lot), so I will troubleshoot the problem, solve it and tell him what I do to solve the problems. 

    Sometimes, other team also tries to reach us and seek for technical help. They lose all the data on the level, and 2 hours left to submit our game ! We tries to discuss together and see around whether has some weird workarounds to recover back the data.

    We also receives the help from other team to help us test-playing the game and give comments on our work.

They provide teachers on both, the technical aspect and the art aspect. In my case, I'm an animation student. I had some problems exporting the animations to work in Unity (we had only ever created animations through rendering) and needed a teachers help to learn the format for animations to work for Game Engines. Similarly, I also needed his help to figure out how to work Substance with Unity. As it turned out, Unity had disabled that feature in their last update and nobody could figure that problem out until after we had gotten some sleep (it was 3 in the morning)

I asked for help from a classmate when I encountered a problem with the skinning of my character. She couldn't help, but it turned out that was a glitch anyways.

I would help other teams if their artists were underclassmen of mine. Several second and first years (I'm a third year) would ask about the exact formats that were needed to work with unity (I was one of the only two artists in the jam who had taken part in the GGJ before), or to figure out problems they had with whatever programs they were using (a surprising amount of them originated from photoshop)"|Mentors/organizers|Female|24|High school degree or equivalent (e.g. GED)|Less than one year|Yes, one game jam|Technically speaking, I'm CG animation student, but our skills are also applicable in Game Development

As our team was not there, I cannot answer this question properly. In terms of helping others, it is the same. A reliance on opening our mouths and talking to others is usually the first step. Most of the time, unless a team is rushing, I think the people in a game jam would react positively and help in whatever way they can if you ask them.

One incident I remember seeing when I was waiting for the theme to show, would be finding someone who arrived without a team. They were hoping to pair up but unfortunately, we all had enough members. However, one of us went to get an organiser. They helped organise and made a brand new team of solo workers and the program went on smoothly.

Something else I remembered was when a group of developers went around asking for volunteers to test their game and get feedback. Lots of people went over to help out. I really think it is something that can only be seen at a game jam site, as most people might refuse to help out if you approach them randomly on the streets to ask."|Other jammers in the same location|Male|19|High school degree or equivalent (e.g. GED)|One year|Two game jams|Yes, as a student
